    <p><strong>Cooking Steps:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Set your steak out to warm up to room temperature before seasoning</li>
        <li>Once the steak is to room temperature, generously apply salt and pepper to both sides</li>
        <li>Place a pan on the stove at medium-high heat</li>
        <li>Once the pan has warmed, add in either butter or olive oil and coat the whole pan</li>
        <li>Add your steak to the pan and cook to your desired finish (we reccomend medium rare for this dish)</li>
        <li>When your steak is done, place onto a plate to rest while we cook the Eggs</li>
        <li>In the same pan, add more olive oil or butter if needed</li>
        <li>Crack 2 eggs into the pan</li>
        <li>Once the bottom of the eggs have set (roughly 2 minutes), flip them in the pan</li>
        <li>When the eggs have cooked on both sides, remove from the pan and add to the plate next to the steak</li>
        <li>Add additional seasonings per your liking and enjoy!</li>
